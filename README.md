Simple REST API Go microservice built as hexagonal architecture (echo framework)
Hexagonal Architecture tackles this issue by building the application around the core. The main objective is to create fully testable systems that can be driven equally by users, programs and batch scripts in isolation of database.

For frontend I use Angular framework. 

Install:
docker-compose up
